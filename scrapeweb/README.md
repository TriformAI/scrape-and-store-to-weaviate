# Triform.ai Template: HTTP GET Request Handler

## Overview

This Python module, designed for Triform.ai, serves as a template for handling HTTP GET requests. It fetches and returns webpage content in JSON format, which can be incorporated into broader AI workflows on the Triform platform.

## How it Works

The `handler` function accepts two parameters: `event` and `context`. `event` should contain a key `input_0` that holds a URL. The function checks the validity of this URL, makes an HTTP GET request, and returns the webpage content.

## Use Cases

- Fetching data from external APIs for processing.
- Integrating real-time web data into AI models.

## Customization

Users can modify the module to handle different types of inputs or to work with other HTTP methods (e.g., POST, PUT) by adjusting the `requests.get()` method to other methods like `requests.post()`.
